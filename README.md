## About The Project

![Screen Shot](CST-150-Milestone/images/screenshot.png)

Activity 1

The first homework assignment of CST-150: C# 1

**Install the necessary software for the course.**
*Visual Studio Enterprise installed.*

**Use the .NET environment to develop a simple graphical user interface using built-in tools**
*Student Record Viewer, sort of overkill, yet the power of .NET made it easy.*

Demonstration: https://youtu.be/k51AgWwLeVE

## Built With

Compiled with the latest installation of Visual Studio with .NET 6.0 and C# 9.0.

* [Visual Studio 2019 Enterprise](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
* [.NET 6.0 (preview)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)

## Getting Started

.NET 6.0 (preview) is optional, but at least .NET 5.0 is required; C# 9.0 required.

## Usage

Using this software is pretty much straight-forward. Enroll a student and enter in the required information.

#### Do Note
A Picture is required as the program will crash if no picture is specified. No checks were put in place yet and will be updated in the next commit.
